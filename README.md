# javascript

In this repo I will upload the homeworks for the course "Keeping Up With the Javascripts: ES6" from pirple.com
I want to showcase what I'm learning. If you're also a student of this course, please don't copy any of these. It's fun to code and figure things out on our own, isn't it? Anyway, if you have any question, feedback or comment, let me know.

I'm just venturing back into social media, focusing on web development.
